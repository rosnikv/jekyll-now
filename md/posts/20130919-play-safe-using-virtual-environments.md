# Virtual environments : Play safe in small Python Projects !

Creating virtual environment for small projects(python)  was new information for me.

This allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects.

Let us check how to set up this.

Install pip or easy_install (easy_install and pip are python package installers that will make your life a lot easier when developing in python)

sudo yum install python-pip``

```` Virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments.

sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper

Make a directory to store your virtual environments(depends on your project number :) )

mkdir virtual_env

Create a virtual environment

virtualenv virtual_env/virt1

To start using the virtual environment , you need to activate it.

source virtual_env/virt1/bin/activate

If  you are done with it, you can close it using command

deactivate

To delete a virtual environment, just delete its folder.

To install packages /modules, you can direct installation to the specific environment for  corresponding project. For example

 ~/virtual_env/virt1/bin/pip install requests

 ~/virtual_env/virt1/bin/pip install Django

These steps are with virtualenv . When you have a lot of virtual environments and it is difficult to handle , virtualenvwrapper will help. Install it using your favourite package installer.

Make sure you installed virtualenvwrapper already

source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Create a virtual environment using virtualenvwrapper

mkvirtualenv virt1

This create a virt1 directory in current path.

To work with it:

workon virt1

This will deactivate the environment you are currently in.

 We can use _deactivate_ command here also.

Virtualenvwrapper provides some useful commands to deal with these environments like,

To remove :

rmvirtualenv virt1

To list  :

lsvirtualenv virt1

Happy Coding !!!
