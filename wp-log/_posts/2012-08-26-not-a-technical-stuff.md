**A book which strike my mind...**

Fortunately I got a chance to read the book "Wise & Otherwise A Salute to life" by Sudha Murthy. It includes 51 short experiences. How human behaviour is changing with time. The narrations happened or still happening in india. The letters of first page strike me a lot it says 'For the 'shirtless people of india' who have taught me so much about my country'. We have to change ourselves before going to change the world. We have to raise our voice against the things that shouldn't happen. But before that make sure we are not going to do the same. The book (through book Sudha Murthy) says many things she learned from her experience, so while reading this book we can feel like we are living in those incidents. We could relate the story with ourselves, or the people whom we know. Book Summary A man dumps his seventy-year-old father in a oldage home declaring him to be a homeless stranger; a tribal chief in the sahyadri hills teaches the author that there is humility in receiving too; and a sick woman remembers to thank her benefactor even asshe is dying. These are just some of the poignant and thought-provoking stories about people from all over the country that Sudha Murthy recounts in this book. From incredible examples of generosity to the cruelest acts one can expect from men and women,she records everything with wry humour and a directness that touches the heart. Stove bursts?or dowry deaths? it's all about the stories of women they are sacrificing the altar of society's greed. Treat me as human, is another story telling about a poor family having a roadside shop and they are not willing to take the author's money and says 'we're not beggers' but author gave it to their child,surprisingly later they gift author behalf of their child,there are people who desired to be treated as a human being and not as some faceless machine. Three Bright Young men,Cause;Then Cure ,A life with dignity,Wretched of the earth...are some stories of the book which capture us with its title. These story contents shows what is happening in india,what kind of people are living in india ,about different people with different nature etc,We cannot discriminate a man with his job,his situation,or his appearance. India does not always mean technology,fashion,films or beauty contests.The real India is in the dark,neglected interiors of our country. Helpless and miserably poor people live beyond the reach of any government departments. To serve our country means to serve such people. That is the author said in one of her story and** I admire her for that. I wish I could do something with this motivation.**
