## Head to Github blog now!

Recently I migrated from my wordpress blog (quite outdated though :wink:) to Jekyll. This is simple, minimal static
site generator.

Just listing out the quick procedure:

1. Export the wordpress contents.
2. Convert the wordpress dumped xml to markdown.
3. Set up Jekyll in your system.
4. Or fork **barryclark/jekyll-now** for easy set-up: in that repo the procedure to get your username.github.io is given.
5. Spent some time to arrange your old posts in new environment.

Hurray, Your blog is up!

Wait, Do you want to create different categories of post? Then read some more :smirk:
I spent some amount of time to get these things done.

If your posts are coming from different categories, for eg., technical and non-technical contents. Instead of 
            
            --_posts
              |
              --post1.md
              --post2.md
            
you can make this structure
            
            --technical
              |
              --index.html
              --atom.xml
              --_posts
                |
                --text1.md
                --text2.md
              
            --non-technical
              |
              --index.html
              --atom.xml
              --_posts
                |
                --text1.md
                --text2.md

Please make sure to specify the tags/categories in metadata of the post.
